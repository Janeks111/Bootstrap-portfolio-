# Bootstrap-portfolio-

## Description

I made this portfolio to showcase my skills to the potential recruiters.
The portfolio was made with HTML and CSS and Bootstrap.

While woking on this project I mostly used Flex box to move elements in one dimentsion, Bootstrap ready made code and customised it with CSS.
